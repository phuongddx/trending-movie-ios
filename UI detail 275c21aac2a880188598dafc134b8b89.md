# TMDB-based iOS Movie App — Screen-by-Screen Detailed Descriptions

Based on the provided design system and feature specification, I'll describe each major screen in detail. This includes layout structure, visual elements (using the color palette, typography, spacing, and reusable UI components), interactions, theme considerations (Light/Dark modes), accessibility notes, and how features integrate. Screens are organized logically from entry points to deeper navigation, ensuring scalability via the system structure (foundation tokens → components → patterns → screens).

All screens adhere to the 8pt grid system for spacing (e.g., sm=8pt, md=16pt, lg=24pt margins/padding), dynamic typography scaling for accessibility, and centralized design tokens for consistent theming. The app shell handles navigation (e.g., tab bar or navigation stack) and theme switching, with flat elevations in lists and subtle shadows/glows on cards (warm amber glow in Dark mode, soft shadows in Light). Contrast ratios meet WCAG AA+ standards, with VoiceOver support for all interactive elements.

## 1. Home Screen

**Purpose:** Entry point for discovery and browsing, showcasing curated carousels to engage users quickly. Pulls from TMDB's trending, popular, now playing, upcoming, and top-rated endpoints with local caching for offline "last known" views.

**Layout Structure:**

- **Top: Hero Carousel** – A full-width, vertically prominent carousel (height ~40-50% of screen on iPhone portrait) featuring trending movies of the week/day. Uses HorizontalCarousel component with parallax scrolling for immersion. Each item is a large MovieCard variant: backdrop image (w780 size) with gradient overlay (fading to background color), overlaid title (H1 typography in text.primary), rating chip (top-right, color-coded green/yellow/red based on score), and short meta (year, genres as chips).
- **Middle: Stacked Carousels** – Vertical stack of HorizontalCarousels for categories like Popular, Now Playing, Top Rated, Upcoming. Each carousel has a section header (H2 typography in text.secondary, left-aligned with md padding). Carousels support infinite pagination (load next page on scroll end) and show skeleton loaders during fetches.
- **Bottom: Tab Bar/Navigation** – Persistent bottom tab bar (if using tabs) with icons for Home, Search, Watchlist, Favorites (or combined). Includes a theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) for Light/Dark switching.
- **Ads Integration:** Native banner ad placeholders between every 2-3 carousels (using Banner component, subtle border in border color). Interstitial ad trigger possible on app open (after 5 minutes inactivity).

**Visuals & Theme:**

- **Dark Mode:** Background #12100E, surfaces #1C1815 for carousels. Primary accents #E67E22 for rating chips and CTAs. Subtle warm glow shadows on cards.
- **Light Mode:** Background #FAF8F6, surfaces #FFFFFF. Text.primary #2C2622 for readability. Soft shadows on cards.
- Spacing: lg (24pt) between carousels, md (16pt) within rows. 8pt grid ensures alignment on iPhone/iPad breakpoints.

**Interactions:**

- Tap MovieCard: Navigate to Movie Detail (with shared element transition on poster for smooth animation).
- Pull-to-refresh: Reload all carousels, respecting cache.
- Scroll: Infinite load with shimmer skeletons; offline shows cached data with a subtle offline banner (text.secondary).
- Accessibility: VoiceOver reads carousel titles, card metadata; dynamic type scales all text.

**Offline/Edge Cases:** Displays cached carousels (2-3 pages per category) with a non-intrusive offline indicator. Errors show retry buttons styled as ActionButtons.

## 2. Search Screen

**Purpose:** Allows free-text search with fuzzy matching, suggestions, and results from TMDB's /search/movie endpoint. Integrates quick actions like add-to-watchlist from results.

**Layout Structure:**

- **Middle: Results List** – Vertical list of MovieCards or compact ListRows (for denser results). Supports infinite scroll (page param). Each result includes poster (w342 size), title (body typography), year/runtime meta (caption), rating chip, and tokenized query highlights (bolded in primary accent).
- **Filters Integration:** If advanced, a SegmentedControl or button row below SearchBar for quick filters (e.g., genre chips, year slider). This could lead to the Discover Screen if complex.
- **Ads:** Banner ad at bottom of results list.

**Visuals & Theme:**

- **Dark Mode:** SearchBar background #1C1815, text #F4EDE6. Highlights in #E67E22. Dividers #2C2622.

**Offline/Edge Cases:** Falls back to local history/watchlist suggestions if offline; shows error with retry.
